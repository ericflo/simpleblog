"Another feature that's easy to add is a per-entry way to allow or disallow comments."
From *Practical Django Projects* by `James Bennett`_.

Meme from `James Tauber`_, `Greg Newman`_, `Justin Lilly`_ and `Brian Rosner`_.

 * Grab the nearest book.
 * Open it to page 56.
 * Find the fifth sentence.
 * Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.
 * Don't dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.

The MOST ironic part about this all, is that I was not going to do this meme tonight, and instead write a post.  However, I was so busy trying to beat James Bennett's score on level 3 of `this challenge`_, that I ran out of time for tonight.

P.S. I dare you to beat my now 357,500 points on level 3 of the game in that link.  I bet you can't.
