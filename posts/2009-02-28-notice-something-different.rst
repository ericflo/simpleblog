Several months ago after rolling out the lifestreaming features on this site, I became unhappy with the way that the design scaled with the new feature.  Around that time I did a purely-visual refactor (just templates and CSS changed--no code), but it has sat untouched on my hard drive for several months.

Today I ran across that redesign and since it essentially looked complete, I deployed it to the site.  I'm still not very happy with the design, but I think that this time it's at least easier to read than the last one, which had become very cluttered and difficult to navigate and read.

Let me know what you think in the comments.
