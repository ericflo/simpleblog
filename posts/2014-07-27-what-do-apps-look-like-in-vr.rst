Let's assume that VR or augmented reality is the future.  It's a leap to
make that assumption, because who knows how the marketplace will react to VR,
but let's make the assumption anyway because it's interesting.  What do apps
look like in this future VR world?

Maybe it works like apps do on the desktop, where there's an operating system
interface, and apps have window boundaries that they have to fit within.  This
is the easier choice, since apps and websites already understand this concept
and are able to be mapped into VR without a complete rewrite.  Users are
already understand how to interact with their computer in this way, so it's
easy for people familiar with desktop computing to get going (and a lot of
people are.)  In fact, there is `a cool demo`_ of this working in Linux
already.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8px">
        <iframe width="560"
                height="315"
                src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Dgtba_GpG-U?start=13"
                frameborder="0"
                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

This would be a bummer, if this is the way things go.  While apps are easily
mapped into this desktop environment, they're written without VR in mind.
They don't take advantage of the third dimension: depth.  They don't take into
account your position or your head's tilt.  (There's an argument to be made
that they rarely even take advantage of two dimensions. Most apps and websites
tend to primarily scroll in one direction.)  In this scenario, the win is that
you get more screen real estate to work with than you have with a monitor, and
you get more spacial awareness than you have today using something like OSX's
Mission Control.  To me, this would be like Microsoft's first attempts at
tablets, where they shipped it with a stylus and treated that as a mouse
pointer. That is, it worked, and nothing needed to be rewritten, but it wasn't
compelling enough for users.

Maybe this operating system interface will be written though, because whoever
controls it will make a lot of money. A lot. Also we know by now that
`worse is better`_.  But no, I think we're going to see it play out more like
how games work on the desktop, and how both games and apps do on smartphones
and consoles.  Remember, VR is being driven primarily by gaming right now, so
games will play a large role in setting expectations for how apps will work in
VR.  So let's add this second assumption to our list: apps in VR will take
over the entire field of view, like games do.

Every computing platform that we use today has an understood interaction model.
We have buttons you can tap, surfaces you can scroll with your mouse or finger,
menu/tab/action bars, launchers, app windows, etc.  Which of these things make
the transition to VR, and what new interaction models need to be (re?)invented?
For example, several Oculus demos `are experimenting with`_ letting users
"click" on buttons by having the user "look" at the button with a pointer for a
certain amount of time.  This allows users to interact with the app without
even using their hands.  Even if this exact technique doesn't take hold (it's
somewhat annoying to have to wait for a timeout in order to "click" on
something), it's the experimentation that's happening that's exciting.

.. raw:: html

    <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 8px">
        <iframe width="560"
                height="315"
                src="//www.youtube.com/embed/mQZ_BvM858s?start=14"
                frameborder="0"
                style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto"
                allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

Notice that I put "click" in quotes.  Because there's no clicking in that
technique.  Nor is there any tapping.  We even have to invent new words to talk
about this stuff!

Now in our hypothetical future we've got apps in VR and they take up the
screen.  Facebook bought Oculus, so let's talk about a Facebook property:
Instagram.  What does an Instagram app look like in VR?  Is it a timeline in a
narrow window, as it is today?  Maybe clicking on a photo zooms in on it.  Or
maybe the timeline shows photos going down vertically, and all the comments
are lined up horizontally without needing to tap into a detail view.  Maybe
photos aren't displayed linearly from top to bottom, but more like a huge
Pinterest board projected inside a planetarium-like dome.

So the question of "What do apps look like in VR?" is not hypothetical, it's
a real question that we're in the process of finding out the answer to.  Maybe
VR doesn't take off, or maybe worse really is better and the 3D desktop
interaction model wins.  But I don't think so.  I think someone or some group
is going to figure out how apps are supposed to look and work on VR, and that's
going to be a big deal.
