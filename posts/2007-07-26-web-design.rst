For the past month or so, in my free time I've been working on a potentially very profitable/successful idea.  I've had this idea for years, and have waited for someone else to do it, but nobody did.  This summer seemed like the perfect time to realize this idea, and to see just how far I could go with it.  There have been challenges in writing the back end for it so far, that much is certain, but by far most of my time has been spent looking for a designer.

I realized almost immediately that my design skills are not adequate to realize my idea in any decent way, so one of the first things that I decided was that I would need to enlist the help of a designer.  I have a budget of no more than $1000, so it should be fairly easy to find a decent if not good designer, right?  Wrong!  I never could have imagined that finding a designer would be so hard!

My first tactic was to email the guy who created inviteshare.com, because I like that design a lot and think he's a budding web designer who just needs to be discovered.  He responded, seemingly interested, and as soon as I presented my entire idea he was gone.  I'm actually fairly suspicious that he'll try and implement it himself, effectively stealing it from me.  But judging from his previous *development* work, I don't think I have too much to worry about.

My second tactic was to troll at a community for web designers/developers, like sitepoint.com, and look for potential candidates there.  One can not appreciate just how many AWFUL designers there are out there, until they visit the critique section of sitepoint.  And it's the same for all the designer web forums.  For the most part, the good designers don't go there while the bad ones go there to get help from the other bad designers.

My third tactic was to scour blogs of the truly great designers, and look at the comments.

* `Jeff Croft`_
* `Khoi Vinh`_
* `Shaun Inman`_
* `Andy Rutledge`_
* `Bryan Veloso`_

...along with the best agencies:

* simplebits.com_
* electricpulp.com_
* thebignoob.com_

...and so on and so forth for about 30 of the best of the best designers and agencies.

I would look at who posted comments and go to their websites, but even those people--fans of the best--are way too high-profile for my price range.

Right now, I'm not really sure whether to get some books and try and teach myself the principles of design, or to try and earn some more money, or to simply keep scouring the net for that budding designer that's willing to work for me for a reasonable price.

It'll be extremely interesting to see what ends up happening in the coming months.
