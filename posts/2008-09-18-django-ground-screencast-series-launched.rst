Over the past few weeks I've been busy coding, planning, and recording a series of screencasts which walk through the complete process of building a web application, from the ground up, with Django.  First I actually needed to code the site, deploy the site, and release the source code for the site.  Then, I had to go back and decide what in that whole process was worth talking about.  Finally, I had to re-code the site, but this time in front of the camera.  It's been a long process so far and I'm not finished yet, but tonight is the night that I am finally able to unveil the first two episodes.

If you haven't checked them out yet, head over to `their spot on thisweekindjango.com`_.

One thing that I'm a little bit worried about is that, by the very nature of going every step along the way, there are going to be some times where a topic I cover is on the more advanced side of things, and there are going to be topics that I cover which are on the more beginner side of things.  That can be fine, but there's a risk that in targeting such a broad audience, nobody ends up enjoying it.  As long as at least one person gets something out of the screencasts, I'll be happy.

So please, I only have 7 screencasts recorded so far, which means there is still time to turn this boat around!  If you have any suggestions or comments or questions, please leave a comment either here or on the `episode's page at thisweekindjango.com`_.
