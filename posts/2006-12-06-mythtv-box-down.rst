Yesterday the MythTV computer that my roommate and I has died.  That is to say that the hard drives which contained all of the shows stopped functioning.  I think what we're going to do is wipe the hard drives and put only a small main hard drive in the MythTV box, and put the rest into a FreeNAS_ NAS server.

It'll have 2x200GB, 1x160GB, and 1x500GB hard drives by the time we're done, making for a total of 1060GB (just over a terabyte!) of total hard drive space.

Then, we'll have some HDs used for our respective media files, and probably the 500gb drive mapped from the MythTV box as the media storage for all the TV shows.  That way, if something happens to the MythTV box, we don't lose everything like we did this time.  The only problem that I can see is if the network just isn't fast enough for us to store our files on there and access it from our computers simultaneously.

I'm also trying to decide what case will be best to put the new MythTV components in.  Right now I'm leaning towards the Lian Li PC-V880B, but any other suggestions are welcome.
