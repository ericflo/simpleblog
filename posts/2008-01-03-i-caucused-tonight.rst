I just got back from the caucuses, and am happy to report that Obama took our precinct in a landslide.  It was an immensely interesting experience to be a part of this process and it really felt like I was doing something important--because I was.  What was most interesting was that a small group of dedicated Obama supporters conscientiously defected to go support Biden, because the Biden supporters pledged to support Edwards if Biden was not deemed viable.  This meant that Obama lost no delegates, but that Edwards lost one delegate.

It was also great to see celebrities get involved too.  I was sitting about 4 feet away from Scarlett Johansson before the caucus when she was calling people to support Obama.  Didn't know she was going to be there and then looked over to my right and there she was!  I've also heard that Kal Penn was very involved, as my friend got a call from him directly.

Our final precinct results were:
Obama: 5 delegates
Clinton: 2 delegates
Edwards: 1 delegate
Biden: 1 delegate
