I was lucky enough to be able to attend PyCon last year, and hope to do so again, but some great resources are starting to show up online for those who couldn't.  One example is Jacob Kaplan-Moss's talk named `Becoming an Open Source Developer: Lessons from the Django Project`_.

Even if you've read James Bennett's `excellent writeup`_ from the conference, some `audio from the event itself`_ can always be fun to listen to.  Right now that's all I could find, but there's new audio showing up from PyCon every week.  The only way to stay updated is to subscribe to the `PyCon 2007 Podcast RSS Feed`_.
