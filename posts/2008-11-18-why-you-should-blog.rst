Whenever I tell people that I'm participating in this blog post per day event,
most people begin laughing hysterically.  Then the next thing that people
typically do, unprompted, is to start making excuses as to why they don't blog.
Most of the time it is something like, "I don't feel like I have anything 
important to say," and sometimes it's more like "I tried it but nobody was
reading it, so I gave up."  These are valid reasons why someone shouldn't blog.

But you shouldn't make those excuses, and you should blog anyway.  Firstly,
writing is a valuable skill in any profession.  Simply forcing yourself to
write more helps to improve your writing abilities, and ensures that you're
able to organize your thoughts in a way that others can understand.  Even if it
doesn't make your writing any better, it will make you more aware of your
shortcomings as a writer.  Myself, for instance: I have found that a big
problem with my writing is that I start too many sentences with conjugations.
I also use way too much of the passive voice and alternate between subjective
personal pronouns.

Another reason why you should blog is because it forces you to look at things
from different perspectives.  I can't count how many times I've begun writing
an opinion post, and give up after a while because after putting it into
writing, I realize how weak my actual argument is.  It makes me question some
of my opinions.  Conversely, if the argument comes across as strong and
obvious, then I am even more certain of my opinion.

Finally, blogging is a classic chicken-and-egg problem.  If you don't blog,
nobody will read your blog.  If people don't read your blog, you won't want to
blog.  Fortunately if you just remain steadfast during the beginning portion
of your blogging life (and make sure to participate with other bloggers who
talk about similar things as you), then people will surely start to read your
posts.

Honestly now that I'm reading through this article, it seems a bit weak.  It's
11:15PM and I can't think of another subject to write about before midnight, 
though, so this post will have to do!

I hope that you guy start/continue to blog, because it really is a good habit
to get into.
