I love screencasts.  I love them at least enough to create 16 of them this year.
That's why when `James Tauber`_ announced_ that the `Pinax Project`_ would be
having a `screencast competition`_, it made me very very happy!

Pinax_ is already a great aide for those who want to build a website with a
great deal of functionality in a short period of time.  If you haven't checked
it out yet, I really hope that you do.  It tries to take the best of breed
Django applications and glues them together with minimal configurable code and
a set of common templates and conventions.

One area that Pinax could be better about, however, is documentation.  We're
working on it, but it still has a bit to go.  That's one of the reasons why this
contest is so great.  By entering a screencast into the contest, you are really
helping the Pinax community out a lot.

The best part about this contest, however, is that there are prizes!  One prize,
$100 at Amazon, will go to the very best screencast.  A second prize, $40 at
Amazon, will go to the second best screencast.  As of this writing, there are no
entries.  So what are you waiting for?  Head on over to the
`contest details page`_ and enter your screencast today!
