A late night thought-walk, internally true.
Light's departure triggers some strange happiness.
Oh unyielding glee of solitude, why be?
A certain alertness; strange, alluring, needed.

Screams of modern times,
deadened by the silence of themselves.

A glimmer of tomorrow tugs mercilessly on the fabric of tonight.
The inescapable growl of fatigue, revealing the never ending chasm.
Familiar it is, this chasm called yawn.

The body cannot fight the need.
It must, but it cannot.

It will not fight

not fight the NEED

To SLEEP
