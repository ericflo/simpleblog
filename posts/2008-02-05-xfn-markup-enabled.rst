The recently released `Google Social Graph API`_ was a bit of a wake-up call for me on the power and importance of microformats_.  So I've hacked together a quick implementation of XFN_ for the blogroll, and added a few ``rel=me`` links as well.

I'll follow this sometime soon with a post about how I implemented the XFN on a Django model.
